      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The WebView Community Group aims to identify, understand and reduce the issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred as WebViews) that are used to render Web technology-based content outside of a Web browser (Native Apps, MiniApps, etc).</p>
	<p>This document contains sections describing the use cases that were contributed by multiple authors. Since this document is a group note, additional use cases will be added in future revisions of this document.</p>

            <dt>Motivation</dt>
            <dd>
            It is quite common to use WebView in Native App development, due to WebView’s benefit of cross-platform interoperability. But the page loading performance of WebView cannot satisfy Native App well, which means the loading of a WebView page is quite slower than loading a Native page.
            <br>
            <br>
            The below is WebView page loading, it firstly shows the white screen.
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="WebView page loading" src="./images/Load-WebView-Page.gif" width="400">

                  WebView page loading
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            But for the Native page loading as shown below, it shows the skeleton immediately, which gives a better user experience compared with WebView.
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="Native page loading" src="./images/Load-Native-Page.gif" width="400">

                  Native page loading
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            Therefore, how to enhance the loading performance of WebView page needs to be addressed.

            The reason of long white screen is due to serial execution in loading a WebView page. The duration of white screen directly depends on the time cost from routing intercept to JS download & parse & exec as described in the following figure.

                <ul>
                    <li>In the Browser: Prefetch, Preload and Next are used to pre-request resources (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Img, etc.), but they are not supported or only partly supported by WebView.</li>
                    <li>What’s more: how to pre-request the data (JSON, XML, etc.)
                    <br>
                    Take e-commerce App as example. WebView is used to render the page of product list and product info. So, a request to fetch the data is needed, and the data is described and transferred in the format of JSON or XML. Sometimes, user info is also carried in the request, to obtain the personalized product info. If the data can be pre-requested, the performance of loading a product page can be increased.

            <dd>
            In a hybrid Native/WebView app, some Native app may load first-party website or third-party website through WebView. So, the Native app and the WebView may make the exact same calls in first-party business, or Native app handles the resource request on behalf of WebView and the corresponding response data returned to WebView can even be different with what is received by Native from the backend server. Also, not all requests want to be proxied through Native, WebView user want to proxy a small number of requests locally to load offline resources.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some scenarios:
                <ol>
                    <li>Document access control: it is expected to manage the access control of Web access documents, allowing different users to access documents of different levels.</li>
                    <li>Security firewall: In order to meet compliance requirements, network engineers want to audit requests within the app, and do not allow insecure requests to be sent on the web.</li>
                    <li>Transcoder: In special scenarios, we may need to convert GIF images to JPEG images to send to reduce traffic, and may also need to translate documents to meet communication needs in different language scenarios. For example, it's hard for a user to communicating in English. When communicating, the user can type Chinese and it will be automatically translated into English.</li>
                    <li>Anonymous: Some users may have higher requirements for the privacy of Web access, requiring that requests within the Web must remove identity features (such as client IP address, From header, Referer header, cookie, URI session ID), providing a high degree of privacy and anonymity.</li>
                    <li>Reducing network requests: A hybrid app (in the sense that some screens are native code and other screens are Webviews) may make some of the same network requests (HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or other network connections supported by webviews such as Web Sockets and WebRTC) in both the native screens and the webview screens. Being able to easily share those responses between native and web (while maintaining proper HTTP cache semantics) would reduce redundant requests, saving end-users bandwidth and reducing server traffic.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <aside class="note">
                    <p>
                        The open questions on handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) & whether we should distinguish access between first-party and third-party content needs to be further considered.

            This is currently even possible in some way, but it is not a recommended pattern. So making this a standard that is easy to use for both Native and WebView developers would be a win for both groups.

        <h2>Render WebView Components and Native Components in same layer</h2>

            <dd>
           Hybrid Native/Webview App and MiniApp often use both WebView Components (text, label, button, image, etc.) and Native Components (such as video).
                <ol>
                    <li>Add a map: due to that developing a Web-based map component is difficult and not so good performance, developers may choose to use the Native map component. Usually, developers cover the WebView with the Native map component. But very often, the Native map will cover all the Web components rendered by WebView. And it is difficult to display one or several Web components on the Native map.</li>
                    <li>Integrate a third-party content into WebView: from the business perspective, Native App needs to integrate third-party advertisements into the some App UI pages which are rendered by WebView. Many third-party advertisements are implemented based on Native components. How to integrate Native components with WebView smoothly?</li>
                    <li>WebView interacts with Native component: developers have implemented a fancy UI page based on WebView, and then the WebView needs to use an extra Native component. How can the Native component interact with WebView smoothly? Like how to let Native component reuse the event handling and message interaction that have been implemented in WebView?</li>
                </ol>
                Unlike WebView Components, the Native Components are rendered by Native App instead of WebView. While Native Components can bring more features by complementing WebView Components, Native Components also bring issue for developers due to that Native rendering is independent of WebView rendering.
                <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, Native Component cannot be controlled by z-index property, and cannot overlap with WebView components, as illustrated below.
                
                <figure>
                    <img alt="Without-same-layer-rendering" src="./images/Without-same-layer-rendering.png" width="400">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                But if the Native Components can be rendered in the same layer of WebView Component, AKA in the WebView Layer, developers can easily control the Native Components as well as the overlapping with other WebView Components, as illustrated below.

            User scripts (aka content scripts) is a powerful tool that unlocks many possibilities such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>content customization (e.g. applying custom CSS, adding UI elements)</li>

                    <li>enriching web app functionality (e.g. filling previously saved passwords, translating text to foreign language, polyfilling missing APIs)</li>
                </ul>
                Injected scripts can also be a workaround when another WebView feature is not available: for example, due to the lack of granular cookie control in native WebView APIs, one method is to <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/blob/main/src/features/cookie.js">inject a script</a> to augment `document.cookie API`.

            Web extensions have a similar concept of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts">content scripts</a>, however the features provided by the native WebView implementaions are much less versatile and not standardized.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most platforms implement a basic `evaluateJS(<string_payload>)` kind of method, which allows to execute arbitrary JS code in the page context. However, it is limited, and lacks some important features that would make developers live easier if they were cross-platform:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Run scripts in isolated world</b>
                    <br>
                    It is common for web pages to change JS prototypes and global variables. This can easily affect the scripts injected by the native app. This can lead to security and privacy issues, and is very hard to prevent. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/#isolated_world">Isolated world</a> prevents these collisions by running the content script within its own JS environment, while still allowing it to access the DOM. Moreover, scripts in isolated world are not affected by CSP and other restrictions imposed on the page scripts.
                    <aside class="note">
                        <p>Isolated world is not a replacement to the main world</p>
                        <p>Isolated world (called "content world" there) is available on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkcontentworld">Apple platforms</a>; Android and Windows WebViews can only execute code in the page context ("main" world)</p>
                    </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Inject scripts in all iframes, including cross-origin and sandboxed ones</b>
                    <br>
                    This is currently a serious limitation on Android, which only allows executing in same-origin contexts. For DuckDuckGo browsers, this makes it very difficult to apply tracking protections, since trackers often operate in a third-party context.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Inject scripts before all page scripts</b>
                    <br>
                    Web extensions have a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/#run_time">"run_at"</a> paramenter that controls when the script will be executed. This is crucial for any security and privacy customizations that need to apply protections before any malicious script can take effect. For example, <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/blob/main/src/features/fingerprinting-screen-size.js">anti-fingerprinting protection</a> augments the APIs, but it only protects from scripts executed after it.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkuserscriptinjectiontime">WKWebView</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2.addscripttoexecuteondocumentcreatedasync?view=webview2-dotnet-1.0.1245.22">WebView2</a> can do this (although API approaches are different), but Android WebView doesn't allow it
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Secure messaging between the native code and injected scripts</b>
                    <br>
                    Content scripts often work in combination with the native components and so require communication. For example, in DuckDuckGo browsers scripts use this to read user configuration (which is managed by the Native App), and trigger native UI changes on page-generated events.
                    <br>
                    WKWebView provides a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkscriptmessagehandlerwithreply">convenient API</a> for passing async messages, but Android WebView and Windows WebView2 do not have an alternative. It is possible to achieve a one-way communication by exposing global JS callables, but without isolated world this is insecure, since page scripts would be able to use those globals too.

                    Some scripts are designed to change the JS environment of the page scripts. For example, DuckDuckGo cookie protection <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/blob/main/src/features/cookie.js">deliberately changes</a> the `document.cookie` API to protect against long-lived tracking cookies. However, there is currently no (straightforward) way to do this in Workers, which have access to powerful APIs as well (e.g. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API">Cookie Store API</a>)
                    <br>

            <dd>
                In browsers, many of these issues are solved by Web Extension API. A lot of design patterns could be (and already are) borrowed from there. WKUserScript is clearly inspired by, and probably built upon the same technology.
                <br>
                However, just exposing the WebExtensions API might not always be the right solution: WebViews are embedded in Native Apps, which operate and protect under a different security and performance model. In general, WebView should probably give more raw control than WebExtensions API.

            <dd>
            In apps that can load arbitrary web apps, such as WebView-powered browsers, it is desirable to give users control over website permissions via custom native UI. For example, a browser can prompt a user to allow a web app to access the camera, and then show an indicator while it's being used. To allow browsers to manage permissions, we need WebView APIs to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>List what permissions have been set for a given site (allow/deny/query)</li>
                    <li>Programmatically change and reset them</li>
                    <li>Receive events when a permission is requested or used</li>
                </ul>
                Some examples of permissions include:
                <ul>
                    <li>camera / microphone</li>
                    <li>geolocation</li>
                    <li>screen capture</li>

           There's currently no cross-platform approach and support. Most WebViews provide events / APIs for specific permissions, but the feature parity could be better.

            Some specific examples of limitations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Webkit has ways to control microphone and camera, but doesn't support Geolocation</li>
                    <li>Microsoft's WebView2 support is limited:

            Apps loading 3rd-party web content in WebViews may need more granular control over stored data. For example, DuckDuckGo browsers need this for the Fireproof feature, which allows to make exceptions to the cookie/storage removal.

            As more and more use cases are discussed, it might be helpful to define and name the different uses of WebViews. WebViews can be used in many different ways and some of them are vastly different in terms of privacy and security implications. It could be a good idea to separate them into different categories to discuss them better.

                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Analysis</dt>
            <dd>
                We can already see these different categories of WebViews with the APIs available on the two big mobile platforms. Android offers a powerful WebView API and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/custom-tabs-android-11/">Chrome Custom Tabs</a>. iOS has WKWebView for a rich WebView API and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller">SFSafariViewController</a> for a more browser-like experience embedded in native Apps.
                <br>
                The WebView APIs offer powerful features for example injecting JavaScript or other interactions with the pages loaded into the WebView. These features require the designers of the WebView APIs and App developers to think a lot about the security and privacy implications of their design choices. WebViews that allow the user to navigate the Web freely need to be much more secure and restricted than WebViews that just allow code under control of the App developers.
                <br>
                WebViews are used a lot to build the UI or core features of Apps. These Apps could benefit from more control over the native parts of the App or vice versa the native code might want to have more control over the Web content.
                <br>
                The distinction between browser-like WebViews and full WebViews embedded into Apps is the most obvious one but there are many more like we see with ePub and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">MiniApps</a>.
                <br>
                If there are different types of WebViews with different use cases and feature sets App developers could benefit from more freedom or security and privacy. Browser vendors could roll out powerful features for developers of Apps built around WebViews but still keep the browsers and browser-like WebViews secure.

                WebViews and browsers currently always have the same features and restrictions. Different WebView implementations share different APIs to interact with the WebView content.
